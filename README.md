# Markdown tooling made easy

The desired features this tooling would need to support, based on aims and goals of existing projects, are as follows:

- Text based everything (config and content as code)
- Ease of writing, since all is in markdown
- Ability to customize with CSS
- Can be served by private pages or locally
- Printable
- Presenter notes capability
